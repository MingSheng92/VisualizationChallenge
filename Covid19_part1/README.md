### future work
Schdule refresh, we can configure power BI to refresh the data at an interval so that we can ensure we will always get the latest results.

### Conclusion 
The data used for todays visulaization is pretty easy to work with, where the data is mostly clean, hence it is fairly easy to work with. With some simple steps you can create a visualization with either tableau or power BI.
