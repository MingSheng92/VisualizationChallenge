# Covid 19 visualization Part 2

### Data Source 
The data used in this visualization can be found at [COVID-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

### Tool
[Power Bi](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) 
Python <br />
Jupyter <br />

### Visuzlization
1st draft:

Refined version:<br />
This is the latest version where all the calculation is fixed and refined layout.<br />

Found a bug in previous code in calculating daily new cases, rewrites calculation logic to fix the error: <br />
With vectoriztion, we improved code execution time and fixed the calculation error. <br />

### Steps taken: 
Data transformation: 


### future work
1. Heat map adjustment, as for now the heatmap presentation is barely visible ( not sure if there is any possible way to improve it maybe by using scaler)
2. adding machine learning into the visualiztion, by training a regression model we can predict the future cases (with R or python) 
3. more graphs, now that we have a base that has scracthed the surface, we can add more meaningful graphs to represent our data to answer our questions 

### Conclusion
